## Features

- **Location-based search**: users can specify their current location or any location of interest to find nearby McDonald's restaurants.
- **Distance filtering**: users can set a maximum distance within which the bot will search for McDonald's restaurants.
- **Rating-based recommendation**: the bot provides the first McDonald's restaurant based on ratings, considering it as the primary recommendation.
- **Sentiment-based recommendation**: the bot provides the the best restaurant based on the analysis of the sentiment of users who have already visited it and left a review.
- **Interactive user interface**: the bot offers a user-friendly interface with step-by-step instructions for smooth interaction.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or improvements, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing code style and include appropriate tests.

One significant contribution to the project would be extending the database to include McDonald's restaurants from countries other than the United States. Currently, the bot focuses on providing recommendations based on the available data within the USA from [McDonald's Store Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/mcdonalds-store-reviews).
